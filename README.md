# coffeeshop

A multi-tool for various network related items.

# Origin

I don't know. I like coffee and networking.

# Prequesites

1. **Python 3** and a **MacOS** computer. Later on I'll release a version suitable for _Windows_, but currently my code uses Apple _Airport_ to detect WiFi networks and other things.

# Contribution

Feel free to contribute to my code in any way possible, _I mean, this is GitHub..._ (Just no steal for profit ;-;)

# Instructions

1. CD to directory that Python file is in
2. Run it, _python3 main.py_

That's it! Have fun and don't do bad stuff. **(I AM NOT HELD LIABLE FOR ANY MISUSE OF THIS CODE)**
