# coffeeshop

A multi-tool for various network related items.

# Origin

I don't know. I like coffee and networking.

# Prequesites

1. **Python 3** and a **MacOS** computer. Later on I'll release a version suitable for _Windows_, but currently my code uses Apple _Airport_ to detect WiFi networks and other things.

# Contribution

Feel free to contribute to my code in any way possible, _I mean, this is GitHub..._ (Just no steal for profit ;-;)

# Instructions

1. Open up Terminal
2. CD to the directory that the Python file is in (Look up how to change directories via CLI if you don't know)
3. Run it, _python3 main.py_

That's it! Have fun and don't do bad stuff.
